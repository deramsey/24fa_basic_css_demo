        <h2>Introduction to Jupiter</h2>
        <p>Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is a gas giant known for its stunning beauty and immense size. With a diameter of about 86,881 miles (139,822 kilometers), it could fit more than 1,300 Earths inside it. Its striking appearance is marked by colorful bands of clouds, colossal storms, and an extensive system of moons.</p>
        <h2>The Atmosphere of Jupiter</h2>
        <p>Jupiter's atmosphere is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane, water vapor, ammonia, and other compounds. This unique composition gives rise to its famous colorful bands, known as zones and belts. These bands result from powerful winds that can reach speeds of up to 400 miles per hour (640 kilometers per hour). One of the most iconic features of Jupiter is the Great Red Spot, a gigantic storm larger than Earth that has been raging for centuries.</p>
        <h2>Moons of Jupiter</h2>
        <p>Jupiter is home to an impressive collection of moons, with over 79 confirmed to date. The four largest, known as the Galilean moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Each of these moons has unique characteristics: Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system, Europa is believed to harbor a subsurface ocean that could support life, Ganymede is the largest moon and has its own magnetic field, while Callisto is heavily cratered and one of the oldest surfaces in the solar system.</p>
        <h2>Exploration of Jupiter</h2>
        <p>Jupiter has been the focus of numerous space missions, with the most notable being NASA's Juno spacecraft, which has been studying the planet since 2016. Juno has provided valuable insights into Jupiter's atmosphere, magnetic field, and internal structure, revealing mysteries about the formation of our solar system. The data gathered by Juno helps scientists understand the dynamics of gas giants and their role in planetary formation.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Jupiter continues to captivate astronomers and space enthusiasts alike. Its immense size, dynamic atmosphere, and intriguing moons offer a wealth of knowledge about the universe. As we explore Jupiter further, we unlock secrets not only about this magnificent planet but also about the nature of planetary systems throughout the cosmos.</p>
